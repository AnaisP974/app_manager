# App Manager – First Step of the Flutter Tutorial

![Texte alternatif](./img/flutter_app_manager.png)

- **Creating a new Flutter project**

- **Creating a home page:**  
  In a separate file, I created a package, used a `Scaffold`, applied styling to my widgets, integrated a font from a `.ttf` file, and added images.

- **Making an element clickable with `GestureDetector()`:**  
  Redirecting to another page using the `Navigator.push()` widget.
